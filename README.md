## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering undergraduate with a strong
academic foundation in mathematics and science.

My primary interests lie in theoretical computer science, algorithms,
and understanding how mathematical concepts support modern computing systems.
As part of my studies, I am developing programming skills in Python and
learning basic data structures and problem-solving techniques.

I have explored introductory machine learning concepts through small
academic and hackathon-based projects, which helped me understand how
theory is translated into practice.

I am currently focused on strengthening my fundamentals, improving my
programming skills, and preparing for higher studies in computer science.

My coursework includes university-level mathematics and core computer
science subjects that emphasize logical reasoning and problem solving.

## 🧩 Projects & Experiments

Repositories document coursework, hackathon experiments, and
> early-stage academic explorations.

- **Secure Communication (Academic PoC)**  
  Exploratory academic proof-of-concept project focused on understanding
theoretical ideas in cryptography and secure communication. The project
draws conceptual inspiration from post-quantum and quantum-communication
literature, and implements a simplified classical software model to
demonstrate secure key exchange and message protection principles.
- **ARIMA-Based Anomaly Detection (Time Series)**  
  Academic project using ARIMA models to study CPU utilization patterns
  and anomaly detection using Python.

- **Machine Learning Mini-Projects**  
- Logistic Regression–based diabetes prediction
- Introductory text classification using TensorFlow
